# Training-COCO-pretrained-YOLOv5s-with-Pklot-dataset

This repository contains a project on Parking lot occupancy detection deployed in a commercial centre. Object detection can be inferred via YOLOv5s model pretrained on the COCO dataset. The proposed detection is decentralised by means of smart cameras. Such cameras capture the image of a portion of the parking lot, anchor the parking spaces and, for each of them determine the occupancy status by using a CNN trained off-line. The github link contains the colab notebook with instructions on how to download the dataset and train the model. A report of the project is provided.
